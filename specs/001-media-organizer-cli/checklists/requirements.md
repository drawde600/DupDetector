# Requirements Quality Checklist: Media Organizer CLI

**Purpose**: Unit-test the written requirements for clarity, completeness, consistency, measurability, and coverage (Reviewer audience, PR-level depth). Focus areas: Performance (SC-001), Testing coverage, and deletion/rescan behavior.

**Created**: 2025-10-18
**Feature Dir**: `specs/001-media-organizer-cli`

## Requirement Completeness

- [ ] CHK001 - Are all user stories (Duplicate Detection, File Reorganization, Tagging, File Renaming, Related ID Management) explicitly listed and mapped to acceptance criteria? [Completeness, Spec §User Stories]
- [ ] CHK002 - Is there an explicit requirement and task for export functionality (CSV/JSON) as listed in FR-011? [Gap, Spec §FR-011]
- [ ] CHK003 - Are database lifecycle behaviors documented (creation, update, deletion, `is_deleted`) and mapped to tasks or CLI actions? [Completeness, Spec §FR-021]
- [ ] CHK004 - Is configuration schema and an example `config.json` requirement specified (keys, types, defaults)? [Gap, Spec §FR-008]
- [ ] CHK005 - Are non-functional requirements (performance, logging, security) enumerated and linked to measurable acceptance criteria? [Completeness, Spec §SC-001]

## Requirement Clarity

- [ ] CHK006 - Is the performance target (SC-001: 1TB/100k files < 1 hour) qualified with hardware baseline and which processing steps are included (hashing, DB writes, image hashing)? [Clarity, Spec §SC-001]
- [ ] CHK007 - Is "related files" matching behavior (FR-003) specified with algorithm choice, hash type (phash/dhash/ahash), and a configurable similarity threshold (Hamming distance)? [Clarity, Spec §FR-003]
- [ ] CHK008 - Are rename-template tokens and their exact semantics documented (e.g., `{MD5}`, `{PHASH}`, `{related_id}`, `{YYYY-MM-DD}`)? [Clarity, Spec §FR-012]
- [ ] CHK009 - Is the behavior on filename conflict (how unique suffix is chosen) precisely defined and atomic with DB update? [Clarity, Spec §FR-020]
- [ ] CHK010 - Is the expected behavior of `--rescan` and how it affects `is_deleted`/reconciliation documented? [Clarity, Spec §Assumptions / Quickstart]

## Requirement Consistency

- [ ] CHK011 - Do contract definitions in `contracts/cli.md` match the CLI tasks in `tasks.md` (options like `--move-to`, `--rescan`, `--rename`, and `--update-latest`)? [Consistency, Spec §Contracts vs tasks.md]
- [ ] CHK012 - Are terminology and tokens consistent across `spec.md`, `quickstart.md`, and `data-model.md` (e.g., `photo_hash` vs `PHASH`, `original_name` vs `original_filename`)? [Consistency, Spec §Key Entities]
- [ ] CHK013 - Are storage/DB expectations in `plan.md` (SQLite plus abstraction) consistent with tasks that assume auto-increment semantics (T025/T032)? [Consistency, Plan §Storage]

## Acceptance Criteria Quality

- [ ] CHK014 - Are acceptance criteria for each user story measurable and executable (e.g., for US1: define sample dataset, expected duplicates, pass/fail condition)? [Acceptance Criteria, Spec §User Story 1]
- [ ] CHK015 - Does the spec define how to measure duplicate-detection accuracy (SC-002: 99.9%) and the test dataset properties needed to validate it? [Measurability, Spec §SC-002]
- [ ] CHK016 - Are failure and error-handling acceptance criteria specified (e.g., unreadable file results in logged error + user-facing message)? [Acceptance Criteria, Spec §FR-009]

## Scenario Coverage

- [ ] CHK017 - Are primary, alternate, exception, and recovery flows explicitly documented for long-running operations (scan/reorganize) including partial failure, retry, and resume semantics? [Coverage, Spec §User Stories]
- [ ] CHK018 - Are edge scenarios for extreme scale (very large libraries, network-mounted NAS) documented with fallbacks (e.g., batching, backoff)? [Coverage, Spec §SC-001]
- [ ] CHK019 - Are concurrent operations (multiple simultaneous scans or reorganize + scan) and their resource contention documented? [Coverage, Gap]

## Edge Case Coverage

- [ ] CHK020 - Is the handling of unreadable or locked files specified (skip, retry, fail) and is it consistent across CLI commands? [Edge Case, Spec §Edge Cases]
- [ ] CHK021 - Is the behavior defined when destination paths do not exist or have permission issues for reorganize/move operations? [Edge Case, Spec §User Story 2]
- [ ] CHK022 - Are requirements for dealing with near-duplicate images (same scene, different resolution or edits) documented including tolerance and expected groupings? [Edge Case, Spec §FR-003]

## Non-Functional Requirements (NFRs)

- [ ] CHK023 - Are performance measurement targets broken down to measurable metrics (files/sec, CPU cores, disk I/O assumptions) and associated test harness tasks present? [Measurability, Spec §SC-001]
- [ ] CHK024 - Is there a defined profiling and baseline plan (where to run, what to measure) to validate SC-001? [Coverage, Spec §SC-001]
- [ ] CHK025 - Are security requirements for file operations defined (e.g., path validation, prevention of directory traversal, atomic move semantics)? [Security, Gap]
- [ ] CHK026 - Is data export specification (CSV/JSON) defined with schema, fields and ordering to ensure export/import integrity? [Clarity, Spec §FR-011]

## Dependencies & Assumptions

- [ ] CHK027 - Are assumptions about user responsibility for external file movements documented and paired with `rescan`/reconciliation expectations? [Assumption, Spec §Clarifications]
- [ ] CHK028 - Are third-party tool requirements and their expected locations/version (ExifTool.exe) documented and validated in plan/quickstart? [Dependency, Research §Decision]
- [ ] CHK029 - Is the DB migration and backward-compatibility strategy defined for future schema changes? [Dependency, Gap]

## Ambiguities & Conflicts

- [ ] CHK030 - Is the exact definition of "related_id" and how it should be assigned/merged across datasets unambiguous (conflict/merge rules)? [Ambiguity, Spec §User Story 5]
- [ ] CHK031 - Are phrases like "basic logging" and "user-friendly error message" quantified (levels, retention, location) to avoid inconsistent implementations? [Ambiguity, Spec §Clarifications]
- [ ] CHK032 - Is the performance goal realistic given the "minimal number of libraries" constraint in plan.md? [Conflict, Plan §Constraints vs Spec §SC-001]

## Traceability & IDs

- [ ] CHK033 - Is there a consistent requirement and acceptance-criteria ID scheme referenced across spec/plan/tasks (FR-xxx / SC-xxx / T###)? [Traceability, Spec §Requirements]
- [ ] CHK034 - Do ≥80% of checklist items include a traceability reference to a spec section or a `[Gap]` marker? [Traceability, Process]

## Testing & Verification (Requirement-quality focus)

- [ ] CHK035 - Are automated tests required and mapped to user stories and acceptance criteria (unit/integration/perf) rather than left as manual-only testing? [Coverage, Tasks vs Spec]
- [ ] CHK036 - Are test fixture specifications (sample datasets, expected outputs) defined for the core test scenarios (duplicates, reorganize, rename)? [Clarity, Tasks T010/T017/T026]

## Final Sanity & Release Gate (Reviewer-focused)

- [ ] CHK037 - Is there a defined minimal MVP scope explicitly stated and traceable to a release gate (e.g., US1 only)? [Completeness, Tasks §MVP]
- [ ] CHK038 - Are cross-cutting concerns (performance profiling, security hardening, and CI) present and scoped with owners/todos? [Completeness, Tasks §Cross-cutting]
- [ ] CHK039 - Are there explicit rollback or recovery requirements for destructive operations (moving/deleting files) to prevent data loss? [Edge Case, Spec §FR-005/FR-020]
