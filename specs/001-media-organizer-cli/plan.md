# Implementation Plan: [FEATURE]

**Branch**: `[###-feature-name]` | **Date**: [DATE] | **Spec**: [link]
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/[###-feature-name]/spec.md`

**Note**: This template is filled in by the `/speckit.plan` command. See `.specify/templates/commands/plan.md` for the execution workflow.

## Summary

A command-line application to organize media files by detecting duplicates (MD5) and similar images (photo hash), storing metadata in a database to minimize re-calculation. It will support reorganizing files by date, location, or custom tags.

## Technical Context

**Language/Version**: Python 3.11
**Primary Dependencies**: SQLAlchemy, imagehash, ExifTool
**Storage**: SQLite
**Testing**: pytest
**Target Platform**: Windows
**Project Type**: Command-line application
**Performance Goals**: Process a 1TB media library with 100,000 files in under 1 hour.
**Constraints**: Use a minimal number of libraries.
**Scale/Scope**: The application should be able to handle large media libraries (terabytes of data).

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

1.  **I. CLI-First Development**: Is the feature exposed through a CLI?
2.  **II. Automated Testing (Non-Negotiable)**: Are automated tests included?
3.  **III. Simplicity and Minimalism**: Is the design simple and are new dependencies justified?
4.  **IV. Spec-Driven Development**: Does a specification exist for this feature?
5.  **V. Windows-First Development**: Are all scripts and tools compatible with Windows/PowerShell?

**Structure Decision**: The project will follow a single project structure.

## Complexity Tracking

*Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified*

| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
|-----------|------------|-------------------------------------|
| [e.g., 4th project] | [current need] | [why 3 projects insufficient] |
| [e.g., Repository pattern] | [specific problem] | [why direct DB access insufficient] |
