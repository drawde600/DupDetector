# Implementation Plan: [FEATURE]

**Branch**: `[###-feature-name]` | **Date**: [DATE] | **Spec**: [link]
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/[###-feature-name]/spec.md`

**Note**: This template is filled in by the `/speckit.plan` command. See `.specify/templates/commands/plan.md` for the execution workflow.

## Summary

[Extract from feature spec: primary requirement + technical approach from research]

## Technical Context

**Language/Version**: Python 3.11
**Primary Dependencies**: imagehash (for image hashing), SQLAlchemy (for database access), ExifTool.exe (for metadata extraction)
**Storage**: SQLite (with a database abstraction layer for future MySQL support)
**Testing**: Manual testing
**Target Platform**: Windows, macOS, Linux
**Project Type**: Command-line application
**Performance Goals**: Process a 1TB media library with 100,000 files in under 1 hour.
**Constraints**: Use a minimal number of libraries.
**Scale/Scope**: The application should be able to handle large media libraries (terabytes of data).

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

1.  **Simplicity and Ease of Use**: The command-line interface should be intuitive and easy to use.
2.  **Manual Testing**: All features will be manually tested to ensure they meet the requirements.
3.  **Rapid Feature Development**: The development process will be optimized for speed and efficiency.
4.  **Extensibility and Portability**: The application will be designed to be extensible and portable, with a database abstraction layer and a modular architecture.
5.  **Governance**: The project will adhere to the principles outlined in the constitution.

## Complexity Tracking

*Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified*

| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
|-----------|------------|-------------------------------------|
| [e.g., 4th project] | [current need] | [why 3 projects insufficient] |
| [e.g., Repository pattern] | [specific problem] | [why direct DB access insufficient] |
