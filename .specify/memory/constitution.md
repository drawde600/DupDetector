# DupDetector Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Simplicity and Ease of Use
Every feature must be simple to use and understand. The user interface should be intuitive and require minimal documentation.

### II. Manual Testing
All features must be manually tested before they are considered complete. Automated testing is not required.

### III. Rapid Feature Development
The development process must be optimized for speed and efficiency. It should be quick and easy to add new features to the project.

### IV. Extensibility and Portability
The project should be designed to be extensible and portable. It should be easy to add new functionality and to run the project on different platforms.

### V. Governance
This constitution is the supreme governing document of the project. All other project documents and practices must be consistent with this constitution.

## Development Workflow

The development workflow is as follows:
1. Create a feature specification.
2. Create an implementation plan.
3. Implement the feature.
4. Manually test the feature.
5. Deploy the feature.

## Governance

All pull requests and reviews must verify compliance with this constitution. Any complexity must be justified.
